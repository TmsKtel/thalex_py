Python exchange connector for thalex.

thalex.py has a function for every websocket endpoint with typehints and a recieve function that returns the messages from the exchange one by one.

main.py has a vague minimalistic example of how the connector can be used.

Feel free to use it however you want, just remember that it comes without warranty.

If you spot any errors/bugs please report or create a pull request.
